# connected-components-graphs
A Python implemtation of disjoint-sets data structure to find and list all connected components a graph using disjoint-sets. Based off Cormen's "Introduction to Algorithms". Graphs may be written in Python the same way they are written with mathematical set notation. Python syntax and set notation coincide in the code.
